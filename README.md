# Banner Report

A LaTeX class for a two column report with a fancy title page.



## Title page

Call the `\titlepage{banner.pdf}` command at the beginning of your document, but replace `banner.pdf` with the banner image you'd like to use. The file should be a 3.55 in Ã— 9.6 in PDF. You may be able to use other image formats if the DPI information is embedded like it is for PDFs, but that behavior has not been tested.

You can fill in the other areas on the page with the following commands 

```latex
\title{Banner Report}
\subtitle{A Stylish \LaTeX Class}
\info{Sep 2019 \\ v0.8}
\author{ {\small prepared by} \\ Arya Daroui}
```
